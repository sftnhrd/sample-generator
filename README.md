# Sample Generator
Sample â€” object instance with fake data used for testing.
This Xcode Source Editor Extension will generate Swift samples based on object declarations.
Handy if you have a rather complex model type with nested structs and you have to write a lot of boilerplate code.

## Usage
Open a file with models that should have samples
```swift
struct Model {

    enum Variant {
        case first
        case second
    }

    struct Nested {
        let identifier: String
        let amount: Int
    }

    let identifier: String
    let name: String
    let nested: Nested
    let variant: Variant
}
```

Run the extension's `Generate` and all the samples will be generated. All you need now is to fill samples with default values
